## Lab work â„–1: Inheritance, Git and Buns

There are X cities in some country. Residents of this country love to eat buns,
but they are not baked in all cities. We want to create an efficient system for
transporting buns between cities.

Other countries with new types of transport and landscape features are starting
to use our system. We will have to improve the system of transporting buns to
take into account new users!
